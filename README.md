# Reality Radar

Reality Radar was the final project for Texas A&M's CSCE 439 Data Analytics for Cybersecurity. It used [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emineyetm/fake-news-detection-datasets/data) from Kaggle, 
and uses three different machine learning techniques to predict which news articles are real or fake. The results are mixed, but it was a worthwhile learning expierence nontheless. Neither of us had any expierence
in cybersecuirty nor machine learning, so this project was a learning expierene for us both.

I also made a video talking about the project for the class, which you [can find here](https://youtu.be/YMzos-ezbVQ?si=uchwqDNEgL_DqhnH) if you are interested.
